# SliceSamples

## Instructions
1. Copy these files to '...\Image-Line\\\[FL Studio version]\Plugins\Fruity\Effects\Edison\Data\Scripts'.
2. Access the functions inside Edison using the 'Run script' button or 'Tools > Scripting > Run Script'.

## Compatibility
Support for Pascal scripting has been dropped in FL 21.

I'll soon convert this script to Python since it's a massive time saver when splitting old CDDA sample CDs into WAVs.
